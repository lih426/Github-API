# Github-API

Run github_api.py with Python3.

The script takes in Github personal access token and GitHub username provided by the user, and returns information about the given username's repositories.

Generate a new GitHub personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
(When generating a new token, select at least "repo:status" and "public_repo" under "Select scopes".)
