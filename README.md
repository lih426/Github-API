# Github-API

Run github_api.py with Python3.

The script takes in Github personal access token and GitHub username provided by the user, and returns information about the given username's repositories.

Github personal access token is needed once after starting the script.

Generate a new GitHub personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens/new
(When generating a new token, select at least "repo:status" and "public_repo" under "Select scopes".)
